# About

Hey there! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Front End Engineer at Guru in Philadelphia. I spend my days writing React to build our web app, browser extension and Slackbot. To the back end team's chagrin, I am also known to write a bit of Java.

Before joining Guru, I was part of the engineering team at RevZilla, an e-commerce site for motorcycle enthusiasts. While there I helped re-platform the site from Ruby on Rails to Elixir/Phoenix and build out a custom component engine.

In the fall of 2018, I co-hosted a workshop at LibertyJS focused on building a blog using Gatsby. As a career changer, I am hoping to speak more in 2019 and help others transition into tech.
