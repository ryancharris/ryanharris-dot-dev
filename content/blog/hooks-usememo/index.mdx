Up until this point in <Link to="/hooks-revisited">the series</Link>, I have been generally familiar with the hooks we've covered and have used them before at work. It wasn't until I recently started working in a new codebase that I came across [`useMemo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo). Not understanding how it worked or how to debug it was a large part of why I chose to write this series in the first place.

### What is "memoization"?

If you look at the React docs, they say that the `useMemo` hook "returns a memoized value". [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) was **not** a term I was familiar with when I first read it, so don't worry if you haven't heard of it either. We're in the same boat!

Essentially, it is an optimization strategy that returns cached values from functions that have previously been invoked with the same arguments. In other words, instead of recalculating a value functions will return a cached value. This is useful when you have functions doing memory intensive calculations and want to minimize how often they're invoked

Here's my mental model for how this works:

```javascript
// Value must be calculated
add(1, 2)

// Value must be calculated
add(3, 4)

// Cached value returned
add(1, 2)
```

If you want to read more about memoization, checkout [this article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-memoization-in-javascript#toc-a-functional-approach) on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io) by [Philip Obosi](https://twitter.com/worldclassdev). He takes a deeper look at memoization and how to implement your own memoized functions using plain JavaScript.

### Anatomy of useMemo

As mentioned, the `useMemo` hook returns a "memoized value" and takes two arguments:

1. A function
2. A dependency array

Here's an example of how it looks directly from the React docs:

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b])
```

If you have read my articles on <Link to="/hooks-useeffect">useEffect</Link> and <Link to="/hooks-uselayouteffect">useLayoutEffect</Link>, you'll probably recognize this function signature. Just like those hooks, `useMemo` executes the logic inside the function passed to it **only** when one of the values in the dependency array changes. If no array is passed, `useMemo` will re-calculate its return value on **every** render.

The difference here is that `useMemo` is not intended to cause side effects -- those should be handled in the appropriately named `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` hooks. `useMemo` simply calculates and returns a value based on the function and dependency array passed to it and helps with handling expensive computations that may cause your application to perform poorly.

### Optimization

According to the React docs, `useMemo` is meant to be a **performance optimization**. They suggest you get your code to work without `useMemo` and implement it after the fact to avoid recalculating expensive values when a cached value would be more performant.

One thing to note, however, is that you can't really guarantee that `useMemo` will return a cached value when expected. Read the following sentence carefully:

> In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. [[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)]

Essentially, to keep things performant and properly manage memory, React may get rid of a cached value it's not actively using in order to save room for other operations. In this case, `useMemo` will have to recalculate its return value even if the values being passed to the hook have been used before.

### In practice

In the example below, I've created a demo to better illustrate how `useMemo` works. For our purposes, I have stubbed out some functions in order to make the example work properly. However, pay attention to the comments as they will provide further context.

_Note: If you're unfamiliar with <Link to="/hooks-useeffect">`useEffect`</Link> or <Link to="/hooks-usestate">`useState`</Link>, take a moment and check out the previous articles in this series before continuing. Otherwise, these should look pretty familiar to you._

Essentially, our `<App />` component does three things:

1. Makes a call to the NASA API in a `useEffect` hook and fetches a list of NASA facilities, which we store in a `useState` hook.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gvk9-iz74.json")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => {
      setNasaLocations(json)
    })
    .catch(err => console.log("Error fetching data", err))
}, [])
```

2. Observes the value of our `<input />` and stores it in another `useState` hook

```javascript
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("")

<input
  name="search"
  type="search"
  onChange={event => setInputValue(event.currentTarget.value)}
/>
```

3. Passes a filtered array to `<MapView />` via the `coordinates` prop, which represents location information for each facility

```javascript
<MapView coordinates={mapCoordinates} />
```

Technically, we could achieve these three goals without using `useMemo`, however, the NASA API returns to us a list of 484 facilities, which we iterate over in `createMapCoordinates()`. This is **expensive** work, especially if the function runs frequently. On top of that, it calls another function for each item in the array (i.e. `createCoordsForLocation()`), which currently returns a plain JavaScript object.

```javascript
function createCoordsForLocation(lat, long) {
  return {
    latitude: lat,
    longitude: long,
  }
}
```

But imagine that `createCoordsForLocation()` called a backend service for each item in the list to compute its geographic coordinates. This would make our already expensive `createMapCoordinates()` call that much more memory intensive. Since we need to do this to make our app function properly, we can leverage `useMemo` to optimize performance.

Let's look at our use case:

```javascript
const mapCoordinates = useMemo(() => {
  return createMapCoordinates(inputValue, nasaLocations)
}, [inputValue, nasaLocations])
```

First, look at the dependency array (i.e. `[inputValue, nasaLocations]`). Like `useEffect`, this tells `useMemo` only to run when either of those values change. Right now, we only make a call for `nasaLocations` on initial render, so its value will only change once, which triggers the hook.

Our other value (i.e. `inputValue`), represents the value the user has entered in the `<input />`. Anytime the user adds or removes characters from the input, the `inputValue` will change in our `useState` hook and cause `useMemo` to run again.

The trick here is that since we filter our `nasaLocations` list based on the `inputValue`, we can use `useMemo` to reduce computations. Since the hook will return a cached value whenever it receives inputs it has used for computation before, we will avoid re-running all the logic in `createCoordsForLocation()` and `createMapCoordinates()` if the `inputValue` and `nasaLocations` list we're passing in have already been processed.

Of all the hooks we've covered thus far, `useMemo` is one of the harder ones to illustrate as its effect on your application is not necessarily visual, but performance based. Like the React docs say, get your application logic working **without** `useMemo` to confirm the proper functionality. Then, go through your component code and identify any expensive computations as these may be great candidates for `useMemo`!

In the next article, we'll be covering `useCallback`, which also leverages memoization, but is subtly different from `useMemo`. Stay tuned to find out how!
