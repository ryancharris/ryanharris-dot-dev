One of the first hooks you'll probably encounter is `useState`, which replaces the `setState()` function used to update state in class components. The big difference here, however, is that `useState` allows function components to have multiple state values as opposed to one monolithic object. The snippet below illustrates this idea (don't worry about the syntax as we'll be covering that below):

```javascript
// Class component state
class Cart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      apples: 10,
      oranges: 25,
      peaches: 40
    }
  }
}

// Function component using hooks
function Cart(props) {
  const [apples, setApples] = useState(10)
  const [oranges, setOranges] = useState(25)
  const [peaches, setPeaches] = useState(40)
}
```

Not too crazy, right? In this example, all of our values are numbers but the value stored in `useState` can be any JavaScript type, including:
- Strings
- Booleans
- Objects
- Arrays
- Numbers
- `null`

### Anatomy of useState

Let's take one of the previous examples and look at it a bit more closely.

```javascript
const [apples, setApples] = useState(10)
```

First, let's look at what is happening on the right side of this expression. Here, we have the value of `10` being passed as the only argument to our `useState` hook. This sets its initial value to `10`.

On the left-hand side of the assignment, we are destructuring two values returned from `useState` as an array: `apples` and `setApples`. The first (i.e. `apples`), represents the current value of this state. In this case, the value would be `10`.

The second value in the array (i.e. `setApples`) is a setter function that allows you to update the value of `apples` by calling `setApples(200)`, which would update `apples` to be equal to `200`.

While you can technically give these setter functions whatever name you want, the common convention is to prepend the value's name with `set` (ex. `setApples`).

### In practice

To better illustrate the mental model of having multiple states instead of one, I built a simplified version of an e-commerce cart.

The first instance is a function component using three `useState` hooks to manage the quantity values of how many `apples`, `oranges` and `peaches` are in the user's cart. The second is a class component that is still using `setState()`.

As you can see, both components do the same things: keep track of how many of each item a user wants and increment/decrement that value based on button presses.

Take a look at the code and see which one you prefer. While hooks may still be new to you, can you see any benefits from using them?
