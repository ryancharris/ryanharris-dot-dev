### Putting things in Context

[Context is one of my favorite React APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and has a wide variety of uses cases. I've previously written about <Link to="2019-10-27-redoing-search">redoing a search UI using `ref`s and Context</Link>, as well as <Link to="/hooks-useref">how to use the `useRef` hook</Link>. This time around, we're going to cover the `useContext` hook, which is now the way we use Context in function components.

I love the Context API because it **allows you to compartmentalize aspects of your app's data within a sub-tree of components**. Essentially, you have a Provider (think of this as a gloabl value somewhat like a store), which provides access to its data via a `value` prop for child components. Those components can choose whether or not they want to consume the data (i.e. Consumers) at all, which means you can avoid [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling). Here's a rough illustration:

![With and without Context illustrations](./01-context-drawings.png)

In [`class` components](https://codesandbox.io/s/hooksusecontext-class-wdiii), we used a combination of `<Context.Provider>` and `<Context.Consumer>` tags to set up the relationship described above. However, in function components, the `<Context.Cosumer>` syntax has been [replaced with the `useContext` hook](https://codesandbox.io/s/hooksusecontext-hooks-8ss8k).

For context (no pun intended), the snippets below show these two implementations of the same Context. Despite the syntax difference, the functionality is **identical**.

```javascript
function NestedComponent() {
  return (
    <AppContext.Consumer>
      {value => 
        <p>{value}</p>
      }
    </AppContext.Consumer>
  );
}

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <AppContext.Provider value={"Hello from App ðŸ‘‹"}>
          <ChildComponent>
            <GrandChild>
              <NestedComponent />
            </GrandChild>
          </ChildComponent>
        </AppContext.Provider>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Anatomy of useContext

The `useContext` hook takes one argument, a Context object, and provides access to the values from the nearest `Context.Provider` above it in the component tree. Any component consuming data from the `Provider` will **always** re-render any time one of the values changes.

```javascript
const AppContext = React.createContext();

function NestedComponent() {
  const appContext = useContext(AppContext);
  return <p>{appContext}</p>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <AppContext.Provider value={"Hello from App ðŸ‘‹"}>
        <ChildComponent>
          <GrandChild>
            <NestedComponent />
          </GrandChild>
        </ChildComponent>
      </AppContext.Provider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice that even though we're using the `useContext` hook, the way we define our context and `Provider` is exactly the same as our `class` example above. The provider works the same no matter which of the following consumption syntaxes you're using:

1. `useContext()`
2. `<Context.Consumer>`
3. [Class.contextType](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#classcontexttype)

### In practice

In the sandbox below, I have built out a component tree that represents a self-contained search widget using the `SearchInput` component we built in <Link to="/hooks-useref">an earlier article covering the `useRef` hook</Link>.

For the purposes of this demonstration, we are mimicking an API call by loading data about breweries in Philadelphia from `results.json` directly into our `Search` component and displaying them as `ResultCard`s in the `SearchResults` component. Then, whenever the text value in `SearchInput` changes, we filter our results to breweries who have names containing a string matching the input text.

Try it out for yourself below:

<iframe
     src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/hooksusecontext-in-practice-shd17?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="hooks/useContext (In Practice)"
     allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
     sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
   ></iframe>

In `Search`, we have created a `SearchContext` by using `React.createContext()`. By doing this, we will be able to pass down context values to `SearchResults` and `SearchInput` without having to prop drill through our `SearchWidget` component. While we would only be passing props through one additonal component in this example, think about how effective this strategy would be for components nested even further!

To **provide** values to the children of `Search`, we are using the `SearchContext.Provider` to pass data via the `value` prop. We've constructed and are passing an object that has two values:

1. `results` - An array of objects representing breweries
2. `setInputValue` - The setter function from the `useState` hook in `Search` that we're using to store the text value from `SearchInput` (i.e. `inputValue`)

With the `Provider` set up, any of `Search`'s descendant components can **consume** our context values using `useContext`. 

```javascript
const context = useContext(SearchContext);
```

In `SearchInput`, we use the `setInputValue` function passed down via our context to set the state of `inputValue` in `Search` whenever the user enters text in the `<input />`.

```javascript
function handleInputChange(event) {
  context.setInputValue(event.currentTarget.value);
}

<input
  onChange={handleInputChange}
  ref={inputRef}
  type="search"
  className="SearchInput__input"
/>
```

By elevating this state to the `Search` component, we are able to use its value to filter our `apiResults` and pass down a new array (i.e. `results`) to the `SearchResults` component, which renders each item as a `ResultCard`.

Essentially, `Context` allows us to more easily centralize related logic and create a good data management system for this self-contained subtree of components. Theoretically, we could repurpose this widget pretty easily by using different API data and updating a few prop names. Pretty cool!
