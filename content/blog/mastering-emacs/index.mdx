I just started going through ['Mastering emacs'](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) by Mickey Petersen with a new Egghead book club cohort organized by [Ian Jones](https://www.ianjones.us).

'Why emacs?' you may ask. Good question. I've been happily using VS Code for a few years and enjoy it. My interest in emacs is primarily due to one thing: org mode. Imagine Notion, iCal and Todoist (plus more I don't even know about yet) all inside your editor. That's org mode.

Below are my evolving notes as we make our way through the book.

### Week 1
#### Reading and discussion notes
- GNU emacs is most common
- emacs is "for tinkerers"
- Built on elisp
  - 95% elisp
  - 5% C
- Has had a speech interface for 20+ years (emacspeak)
- Some terms predate modern computing terms
  - "killing" -- cutting
  - "yanking" -- pasting
  - "saving to the kill ring" -- copying


#### Usage notes
Commands are semantic:
- **Spc w** -- window commands
- **Spc b** -- buffer commands
- **Spc f** -- file commands
- **Spc p** -- project commands

**Spc o t**
- toggle integrated terminal window

**Spc b b**
- Show recent buffers

To add Prettier formatting:
- Add Prettier to `packages.el`
```
(package! prettier-js)
```
- Require Prettier in `config.el`
```
(require 'prettier-js)
```
- Add hooks to format on save in TypeScript and JavaScript modes
```
(add-hook 'javascript-mode 'prettier-js-mode)
(add-hook 'typescript-mode 'prettier-js-mode)
```
