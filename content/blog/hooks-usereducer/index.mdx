### An update on state

Throughout this series, all of the code snippets and sandboxes we've created have used `useState` to manage our component data. However, React offers us an additional hook to use for storing data: `useReducer`.

While `useState` allows us to store and set a single value, `useReducer` helps us work with more complex or structured data by letting us to store and manipulate related values alongside one another.

### Anatomy of useReducer

Like `useState`, `useReducer` returns an array with two values:

- The current state
- A function used to update the state

```javascript
const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

The `useReduce` hook also takes up to three arguments:

The first argument is a **reducer function**, which defines the logic associated with each reducer action and the logic for updating state whenever a specific action is fired. We'll see an example of how this works in a moment.

Secondly, we pass the `useReducer` hook a value that represents its **initial state**. This effectively works in the same way as the value you pass to the `useState` hook.

The third argument is an **optional initialization function**. According to the documentation, this is useful for...

### Difference from useState

To best illustrate the difference in how `useReducer` and `useState` update their state values, respectively, let's take a look at them side by side. The snippet below shows the code you'd need to use to instantiate and update a state value using both hooks:

```javascript
// useState
const [name, setName] = useState("")
setName("Ryan")
console.log(name) // 'Ryan'

// useReducer
const initialState = {
  name: "",
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "update-name":
      return {
        ...state,
        name: action.value,
      }
  }
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
dispatch({ type: "update-name", value: "Ryan" })
console.log(state.name) // 'Ryan'
```

While `useState`'s setter function updates its value directly, `useReducer` dispatches an action. The reducer function then determines what type of action was fired and, subsequently, how to update its state.

_Note:_ If you haven't used it in the past, this is pretty much how [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) works.

### In practice

In the sandbox below, I've built a form for scheduling an appointment. Though there are multiple inputs with different types, all of the values are related to one another as they are in the same `<form>`.

Instead of storing each input value in its own `useState` hook, we can store and manage all of the values in our form using a single `useReducer`. In this case, its state is an object with many keys, each representing a different value we want to store. Personally, this reminds me a bit of `this.state` in `class` components before we had hooks.

In `App.js`, we've defined our initial state like this:

```javascript
const blankForm = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
  date: "",
  time: "",
  feeling: "3",
}

const [formState, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, blankForm)
```

Each of the fields in the `blankForm` object represents and stores the value for an associated input in our form. Since the initial state of `email` is an empty string, the e-mail input will be blank on render as it reads its value from `useReducer`'s state:

```javascript
<input
  className="Form__input"
  name="email"
  type="email"
  value={formState.email}
/>
```

To make this work, we've also set our inputs' `onChange` handlers to dispatch specific actions in order to update the state. Here's what our e-mail input now looks like:

```javascript
<input
  className="Form__input"
  name="email"
  type="email"
  value={formState.email}
  onChange={event => {
    dispatch({ type: "setEmail", value: event.target.value })
  }}
/>
```

In the snippet above, we're specifically dispatching the `setEmail` action. Inside of our reducer function, the `switch` statement looks for the `case` that matches the `action.type` and executes its logic to update state:

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "setName":
      return {
        ...state,
        name: action.value,
      }
    case "setEmail":
      return {
        ...state,
        email: action.value,
      }
    case "setDate":
      return {
        ...state,
        date: action.value,
      }
    case "setTime":
      return {
        ...state,
        time: action.value,
      }
    case "setFeeling":
      return {
        ...state,
        feeling: action.value,
      }
    case "reset":
      return blankForm
  }
}
```

For example, when `setEmail` is called the reducer returns a new object that contains all of the current state information, except it **also** updates the `email` field.

```javascript
return {
  ...state,
  email: action.value,
}
```

Finally, since our `useReducer` hook's state has now been updated, the component will re-render and the `<input />`s all display their updated value from `formState`.
