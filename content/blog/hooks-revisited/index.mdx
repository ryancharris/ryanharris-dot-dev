> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components [[React docs]](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#but-what-is-a-hook)

Introduced in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1680-february-6-2019" target="_blank">React v16.8</a>, the hooks API represents a change in how developers compose their components. Intended to compartmentalize blocks of functionality, they make reusing code across your application easier. They also mark a shift away from using `class` components and the use of lifecycle methods.

When hooks were first introduced at [React Conf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ), the React team explained the motivations behind them. Essentially, they wanted to solve the many problems all at once:

1. It can be hard to re-use logic between components
2. Complex component files are huge
3. Understanding classes in JavaScript can be difficult to understand (for humans and compilers)

For a **much** more detailed explanation about the origin of hooks, make sure to check out the team's full talk featuring [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/), [Sophie Alpert](https://sophiebits.com/) and [Ryan Florence](https://reacttraining.com/).

### Goals

When the hooks API moved out of beta, my team started using them almost immediately. However, most of the logic for the feature I was working on at the time was contained within class components still using lifecycle methods. When creating new components, I was using function components and hooks; however, the components usually weren't complex enough to leverage more than `useState` or `useEffect`.

Currently, I work in a codebase that was all written after developers started shifting to hooks and I want to revisit (hence the title of this series) how they **all** work, as well as when to use them.

To do that, I am writing an article about each standard React hook. Each piece is linked below and will cover the hook in depth, including code samples illustrating how it works.
